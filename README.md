# Instructions for Code Exercise

We will create a **Random Number Generator**.

1. Clone down the repository locally to your machine
2. Create a new branch
3. Using the `TestView` SwiftUI View add the following:
   - Single Output For Displaying Text
   - Single Text Field
   - Single Button
4. Behavior:
   - Pressing the button generates a single random number (0-3)
     - Code for Random Number: `Int.random(in: 0 ..< 4)`
   - The numbers are displayed in the UI’s Output by default
   - If the number inputted in the Text Field matches the random number generated, show the word “MATCH!” in the UI
5. When complete, commit and push (the push command will fail, its okay, ignore)
